### Run ItyFuzz with UI

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run docker image suitable for your system architecture:

```
docker pull fuzzland/ityfuzz:stable
docker run -p 8000:8000 fuzzland/ityfuzz:stable
```

Then, you can visit the interface at http://localhost:8000

<sub>Note: The container uses public ETH RPC, may time out / be slow</sub>

### Statistics & Comparison

Time taken for finding vulnerabilities / generating exploits:

| Project Name  | Vulnerability           | **Mythril** | **SMARTIAN** | **Slither** | **ItyFuzz** |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| AES           | Business Logic          | Inf         | Unsupported  | No          | 4hrs        |
| Carrot        | Arbitrary External Call | 17s         | 11s          | Yes         | 1s          |
| Olympus       | Access Control          | 36s         | Inf          | Yes         | 1s          |
| MUMUG         | Price Manipulation      | Inf         | Unsupported  | No          | 18hrs       |
| Omni          | Reentrancy              | Inf         | Unsupported  | Yes\*       | 22hrs       |
| Verilog CTF-2 | Reentrancy              | Inf         | Unsupported  | Yes\*       | 3s          |

<sub>\* Slither only finds the reentrancy location, but not how to leverage reentrancy to trigger final buggy code. The output also contains significant amount of false positives. </sub>

Test Coverage:

| **Dataset** | **SMARTIAN** | **Echidna** | **ItyFuzz** |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| B1          | 97.1%        | 47.1%       | 99.2%       |
| B2          | 86.2%        | 82.9%       | 95.4%       |
| Tests       | Unsupported  | 52.9%       | 100%        |

<sub>\* B1 and B2 contain 72 single-contract projects from SMARTIAN artifacts. Tests are the projects in `tests` directory. The coverage is calculated as `(instruction covered) / (total instruction - dead code)`. </sub>

# Development

### Building

You need to have `libssl-dev` (OpenSSL) and `libz3-dev` (refer to [Z3 Installation](#z3-installation) section for instruction) installed.

```bash
# download move dependencies
git submodule update --recursive --init
cd cli/
cargo build --release
```

You can enable certain debug gates in `Cargo.toml`

`solc` is needed for compiling smart contracts. You can use `solc-select` tool to manage the version of `solc`.

### Run

Compile Smart Contracts:

```bash
cd ./tests/multi-contract/
# include the library from ./solidity_utils for example
solc *.sol -o . --bin --abi --overwrite --base-path ../../
```

Run Fuzzer:

```bash
# if cli binary exists
cd ./cli/
./cli -t '../tests/multi-contract/*'
```

### Demo

**Verilog CTF Challenge 2**
`tests/verilog-2/`

Flashloan attack + Reentrancy. The target is to reach line 34 in `Bounty.sol`.

Exact Exploit:

```
0. Borrow k MATIC such that k > balance() / 10
1. depositMATIC() with k MATIC
2. redeem(k * 1e18) -- reentrancy contract --> getBounty()
3. Return k MATIC
```

Use fuzzer to detect the vulnerability and generate the exploit (takes 0 - 200s):

```bash
# build contracts in tests/verilog-2/
solc *.sol -o . --bin --abi --overwrite --base-path ../../
# run fuzzer
./cli -f -t "./tests/verilog-2/*"
```

`-f` flag enables automated flashloan, which hooks all ERC20 external calls and make any users to have infinite balance.

### Fuzz a Project (Offline)

You can fuzz a project by providing a path to the project directory.

```bash
./cli -t '[DIR_PATH]/*'
```

ItyFuzz would attempt to deploy all artifacts in the directory to a blockchain with no other smart contracts.

Specifically, the project directory should contain
a few `[X].abi` and `[X].bin` files. For example, to fuzz a contract named `main.sol`, you should
ensure `main.abi` and `main.bin` exist in the project directory.
The fuzzer will automatically detect the contracts in directory, the correlation between them (see `tests/multi-contract`),
and fuzz them.

Optionally, if ItyFuzz fails to infer the correlation between contracts, you
can add a `[X].address`, where `[X]` is the contract name, to specify the address of the contract.

Caveats:

- Keep in mind that ItyFuzz is fuzzing on a clean blockchain,
  so you should ensure all related contracts (e.g., ERC20 token, Uniswap, etc.) are deployed to the blockchain before fuzzing.

### Fuzz a Project (Online)

Rebuild with `flashloan_v2` (only supported in onchain) enabled to get better result.

```bash
sed -i 's/\"default = [\"/\"default = [flashloan_v2,\"/g' ./Cargo.toml
cd ./cli/
cargo build --release
```

You can fuzz a project by providing an address, a block, and a chain type.

```bash
./cli -o -t [TARGET_ADDR] --onchain-block-number [BLOCK] -c [CHAIN_TYPE]
```

Example:
Fuzzing WETH contract (`0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2`) on Ethereum mainnet at latest block.

```bash
./cli -o -t 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 --onchain-block-number 0 -c ETH
```

Fuzzing with flashloan and oracles enabled:

```bash
./cli -o -t 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 --onchain-block-number 0 -c ETH -f -i -p
```

ItyFuzz would pull the ABI of the contract from Etherscan and fuzz it.
If ItyFuzz encounters an unknown slot in the memory, it would pull the slot from chain RPC.
If ItyFuzz encounters calls to external unknown contract, it would pull the bytecode and ABI of that contract.
If its ABI is not available, ItyFuzz would not send any transaction to that contract.

To use proxy, append `--onchain-local-proxy-addr http://localhost:5003` to your CLI command.

### Onchain Fetching

ItyFuzz attempts to fetch storage from blockchain nodes when SLOAD is encountered and the target is uninitialized.
There are three ways of fetching:

- OneByOne: fetch one slot at a time. This is the default mode. It is slow but never fails.
- All: fetch all slots at once using custom API `eth_getStorageAll` on our nodes. This is the fastest mode, but it may fail if the contract is too large.
- Dump: dump storage using debug API `debug_storageRangeAt`. This only works for ETH (for now) and fails most of the time.

### Constructor Arguments

ItyFuzz provides two methods to pass in constructor arguments. These arguments are necessary for initializing the state of the contract when deployed.

**Method 1: CLI Arguments**

The first method is to pass in the constructor arguments directly as CLI arguments.

When you run ItyFuzz using the CLI, you can include the `--constructor-args` flag followed by a string that specifies the arguments for each constructor.

The format is as follows:

```
cli -t 'tests/multi-contract/*' --constructor-args "ContractName:arg1,arg2,...;AnotherContract:arg1,arg2,..;"
```

For example, if you have two contracts, `main` and `main2`, both having a `bytes32` and a `uint256` as constructor arguments, you would pass them in like this:

```bash
cli -t 'tests/multi-contract/*' --constructor-args "main:1,0x6100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;main2:2,0x6200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;"
```

**Method 2: Server Forwarding**

The second method is to use our server to forward requests to a user-specified RPC, and cli will fetch the constructor arguments from the transactions sent to the RPC.

Firstly, go to the `/server` directory, and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd /server
npm install
```

Then, start the server using the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

By default, the server will forward requests to `http://localhost:8545`, which is the default address for [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache), if you do not have a local blockchain running, you can use Ganache to start one.
If you wish to forward requests to another location, you can specify the address as a command-line argument like so:

```bash
node app.js http://localhost:8546
```

Once the server is running, you can deploy your contract to `localhost:5001` using a tool of your choice.

For example, you can use Foundry to deploy your contract through the server:

```bash
forge create src/flashloan.sol:main2 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:5001 --private-key 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 --constructor-args "1" "0x6100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

Finally, you can fetch the constructor arguments using the `--fetch-tx-data` flag:

```bash
cli -t 'tests/multi-contract/*' --fetch-tx-data
```

ItyFuzz will fetch the constructor arguments from the transactions forwarded to the RPC through the server.

### Z3 Installation

**macOS**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 && cd z3
python scripts/mk_make.py --prefix=/usr/local
cd build && make -j64 && sudo make install
```

If the build command still fails for not finding `z3.h`, do `export Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER=/usr/local/include/z3.h`

**Ubuntu**

```bash
apt install libz3-dev
```
